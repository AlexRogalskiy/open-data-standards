## Executive Summary
This document is an effort to outline the state of open data standards in several civic domains, as well as to suggest domains in which there is strong potential for developing new standards or some nascent work is complete but adoption is not yet widespread.

## Why write this report?
Azavea is a B Corp whose mission is.... 

We have been involved in open data in a number of ways for several years: OpenDataPhilly, VIP, GoPhillyGo, open source, etc.

## Why do open data standards matter?
Open data + open standards + open source

Make open data more valuable by making it easier to build new tools and applications
Enable comparisons between locations
Support the development of an ecosystem
Stories: GTFS, LIVES

We organized these standards into standards that are in use and already having an impact and potential future standards - nascent efforts that are not yet widely adopted but have potential and may turn into new standards down the road.


## Criteria for Selecting Standards
This report is organized into two sections, one for standards that have been released and are in use in at least a few cities, and a second section for potential new standards.

The criteria used to select the standards includes the following:

*   *Location-based* - Azavea is a geospatial analysis and visualization company, so we have focused on standards that have a location component
*   *Published standard* â€“ Documentation for the specification has been published and is available online
*   *Machine-readable* - Based on JSON, CSV, XML or similar structure
*   *Adoption* - Adopted by at least one large city or heavily used by an aggregator of civic data

## What can I do to support open data standards?
Local open data portal, see if it's being published to a standard, if not, contact open data people
Build new tools that leverage standards - CfA brigades
Talk to local elected officials about open data
Contribute to OpenStreetMap - HOT, MissingMaps
