## Executive Summary
This document is an effort to outline the state of open data standards in several civic domains, as well as to suggest domains in which there is strong potential for developing new standards.

## Criteria for Selecting Standards
This report is organized into two sections, one for standards that have been released and are in use in at least a few cities, and a second section for potential new standards.

The criteria used to select the standards includes the following:

*   *Location-based* - We will focus on standards that have a location component
*   *Published standard* â€“ There is documentation for the specification
*   *Machine-readable* - Based on JSON, CSV, XML or similar structure
*   *Adoption and used* - Adopted by at least one major US cities or heavily used by an aggregator of municipal data
