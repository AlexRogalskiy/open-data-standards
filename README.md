## Executive Summary
This document is an effort to outline the state of open data standards in several civic domains, as well as to suggest domains in which there is strong potential for developing new standards or some nascent work is complete but adoption is not yet widespread.

## Why write this report?
Azavea is a B Corp with a mission to apply geospatial technology for civic, social, and environmental impact while advancing the state-of-the-art through research. We work on projects that range from climate change to public transit and from homelessness to public safety. Almost every project we develop relies, at least in part, on open data. We also developed and continue to operate the open data portal for Philadelphia, [OpenDataPhilly](http://www.opendataphilly.org/), and we share much of our work by releasing our software under open source licenses (check out a few examples at [OpenTreeMap](http://www.opentreemap.org/), [GeoTrellis](http://geotrellis.io), and [DistrictBuilder](http://www.districtbuilder.org/)). We want to encourage and cultivate broad use of open data, open source, open standards, and open algorithms, because we believe it results in better, more functional cities.


## Why do open data standards matter?
TODO: write para on why standards matter

Open data + open standards + open source

Make open data more valuable by making it easier to build new tools and applications
Enable comparisons between locations
Support the development of an ecosystem
Stories: GTFS, LIVES

We organized these standards into two groups: 1) those that are in use and having an impact; and 2) potential future standards - nascent efforts that are not yet widely adopted but have potential and may turn into new standards down the road.


## Criteria for Selecting Standards
This report is organized into two sections, one for standards that have been released and are in use in at least a few cities, and a second section for potential new standards.

The criteria used to select the standards includes the following:

 * *Location-based* - Azavea is a geospatial analysis and visualization company, so we have focused on standards that have a location component; that turns out to not limit us very much as the vast majority of data being released by government has a location component to it.
 * *Published standard* â€“ Documentation for the specification has been published and is available online.
 * *Machine-readable* - Based on JSON, CSV, XML or similar structure that can be consumed by software in a consistent, organized way
 * *Adoption* - Adopted by at least one large city or heavily used by an aggregator of civic data

## What can I do to support open data standards?
TODO: write intro to how you can support open data standards
 * Local open data portal, see if it's being published to a standard, if not, contact open data people
 * Build new tools that leverage standards - CfA brigades
 * Talk to local elected officials about open data
 * Contribute to OpenStreetMap - HOT, MissingMaps
