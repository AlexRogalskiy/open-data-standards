**Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption**

The County Clerk or Recorder registers many types of documents, including property title transfers (deeds), mortgages, mortgage satisfaction, wills. These documents are increasingly made available as digital data, but are rarely published in an open, machine-readable data format. There is significant opportunity to both improve the transparency of property records and provide better information on how communities are changing.
