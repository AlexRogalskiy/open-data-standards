# Land Administration Model (LADM)

## Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption

Though there are no data standards designed for publication of open data, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has developed a general land administration data model. This international standard for the land administration domain will, ideally, encourage the use of the data in civic applications and support sustainable development by speeding the use of proper land administration systems.

Countries, states and provinces seeking to eliminate the need to develop their own Land Administration Systems can standardize the system in which deeds (or land titles) are recorded and maintained. The Final Draft International Standard, ISO FDIS 19152, was unanimously passed on 1 November 2012.

This standard may become more important as software tools are developed to support it.
