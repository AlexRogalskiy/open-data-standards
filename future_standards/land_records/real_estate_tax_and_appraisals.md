**Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption**

Real estate property tax assessment and tax paid by property owners is generally public information in most locations in the U.S. However, it is rarely made available through APIs or as bulk, machine-readable downloads. When it is, there are no data standards that would make the process more consistent between cities. Great potential exists for the creation of standards around not only tax values for properties but also the means for which tax values are calculated and disclosed to homeowners. This would be beneficial for property owners and buyers as well as individuals in the appraisal and realty industries.
