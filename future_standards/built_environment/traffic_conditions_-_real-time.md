## Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption

The 511 system was established by the Federal Highway Administration but is implemented separately by each state. Most states have now adopted the standard, and federal funding is provided to support additional extensions. The system provides data on incidents, construction, weather alerts, road closures and traffic speed. Though the “511” moniker implies a phone-based system, many states now provide mobile applications, online maps, and data feeds. However, the system does not have a standard publishing format and it’s use may well suffer from increased use of in-car navigation systems and existing map platforms, such as Google Maps Traffic, that rely on large amounts of crowd-sourced data, rather than a centralized data collection process.
