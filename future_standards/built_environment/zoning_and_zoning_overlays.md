## Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption

Zoning determines allowable uses for land in a community, and while a few cities have rejected zoning, most cities in the United States have a form of zoning code. An Open Zoning Data standard was proposed by Andrew Salzberg at the Open Data Day 2013 Hackathon in DC.

Zonability is a startup that attempts to process parcels and analyze for size and zoning requirements. This type of organization could potentially be interested in developing data standards.
