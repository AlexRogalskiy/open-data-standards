**Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption**

Municipal and county governments have a deep interest in land use. Though land use is related to zoning, it is not necessarily the same.Most cities in the United States have some kind of zoning code, but not all of them, and actual land use is often equally important for planning purposes. The American Planning Association (APA) has developed the [Land Based Classification Standards](https://www.planning.org/lbcs/) which provides planners with a consistent model for classifying land uses based on their characteristics.
