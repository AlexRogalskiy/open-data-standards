## Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption

There are several types of safety inspections performed by government entities. Health inspections are addressed under the [Local Inspector Value Entry Specification (LIVES)](../../standards/domain_specific_standards/local_inspector_value_entry_specification_lives.md) standard description. Infrastructure, such as bridges, embankments and water inlets, also received regular inspections and the transparency of this data varies a great deal between jurisdictions. For workplace safety inspections, the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)](https://www.osha.gov/) maintains large amounts of data on safety inspections. Much of this data is released in aggregate by industry and location, but OSHA also maintains a work-related injury and illness database under the OSHA Data Initiative (ODI) and the ODI data is available as downloadable machine-readable files from 2002 to 2011.
