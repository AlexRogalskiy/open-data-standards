**Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption**

Parking data – including lot locations, meter locations and times, street parking regulations, parking lot locations, pricing, availability – is in great demand but is not generally made available by public agencies. In many cities, there may not be a single source of such data with a mix of public and private parking providers. Standardizing and releasing parking data would enable drivers in congested areas to park quickly and efficiently, reducing carbon emissions and frustration.While a few U.S. cities have released some parking information, it remains a fragmented effort. There are several private firms attempting to improve access to parking data. The best open data example we found was in the Netherlands.
