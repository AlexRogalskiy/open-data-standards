**Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption**

Some states (for example: Indiana [http://www.in.gov/ilrc/2335.htm](http://www.in.gov/ilrc/2335.htm)) have made progress on lobbying data standards but no open standard exists. The Sunlight Foundation developed data recommendations and published a Municipal Lobbying Data Guidebook to help local policymakers and advocates create an environment of stronger lobbying disclosure.
