# Generic Standards: Data Catalogs







## Project Open Data Metadata Schema

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Status** | Rapidly developed but already in broad use |
| **Version Number** | 1.1 |
| **Key Contacts** |  |
| **Implementing Agencies** | Data.gov, several cities |
| **Documentation** | [http://project-open-data.github.io/catalog/](http://project-open-data.github.io/catalog/) |
| **Founding/Sponsoring Organizations** | Project Open Data, Data.gov |

**Background and Analysis**
<br>
Also known as “Slash Data”, this standard was developed by the Project Open Data project sponsored by the White House, and was originally known as Data.json. It is a standardized way to provide published summaries of government open data catalogs. The format was developed in conjunction with a Common Core Metadata standard. While it was developed fairly rapidly, its immediate use by the federal Data.gov portal and active encouragement of adoption by both federal and local data catalogs has driven rapid adoption. The standard is also supported by all of the most common data catalog software tools, including: CKAN, DKAN and Socrata.


## OGC Catalogue Standard (CSW)

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Status** | Broadly implemented in commercial and open source software tools |
| **Version Number** | 3.0 |
| **Key Contacts** | OGC |
| **Implementing Agencies** |  |
| **Documentation** | [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat) |
| **Founding/Sponsoring Organizations** | Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) |

**Background and Analysis**
<br>
The OGC developed the Catalogue Service specifically to support open geospatial data portals and repositories. While originally limited to geospatial data, it has since been used more broadly for non-spatial data and is implemented in several software tools. However, it is possible that CSW will be displayed by the Project Open Data Metadata Schema in coming years.


## Socrata Open Data API (SODA)

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Status** | Commercial company but broadly used |
| **Version Number** | 1.0? (documentation does not list a version number) |
| **Key Contacts** | Unknown |
| **Implementing Agencies** | New York, Chicago, Baltimore and several other large U.S. cities |
| **Documentation** | Getting Started:[http://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started.html](http://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started.html) |
| **Founding/Sponsoring Organizations** | Socrata |

**Background and Analysis**
<br>
The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) is not an open standard in the usual sense – it was developed by a commercial company and the API is not managed through a collaborative process. However, Socrata provides good documentation, and the fact that it is used in several large cities in the United States makes it relevant.

**Analysis**
<br>
Socrata’s data platform continues to grow in importance, and its API is a key source of open data for many cities.
