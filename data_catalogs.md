# Generic Standards: Data Catalogs










## OGC Catalogue Standard (CSW)

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Status** | Broadly implemented in commercial and open source software tools |
| **Version Number** | 3.0 |
| **Key Contacts** | OGC |
| **Implementing Agencies** |  |
| **Documentation** | [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat) |
| **Founding/Sponsoring Organizations** | Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) |

**Background and Analysis**
<br>
The OGC developed the Catalogue Service specifically to support open geospatial data portals and repositories. While originally limited to geospatial data, it has since been used more broadly for non-spatial data and is implemented in several software tools. However, it is possible that CSW will be displayed by the Project Open Data Metadata Schema in coming years.


## Socrata Open Data API (SODA)

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Status** | Commercial company but broadly used |
| **Version Number** | 1.0? (documentation does not list a version number) |
| **Key Contacts** | Unknown |
| **Implementing Agencies** | New York, Chicago, Baltimore and several other large U.S. cities |
| **Documentation** | Getting Started:[http://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started.html](http://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started.html) |
| **Founding/Sponsoring Organizations** | Socrata |

**Background and Analysis**
<br>
The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) is not an open standard in the usual sense – it was developed by a commercial company and the API is not managed through a collaborative process. However, Socrata provides good documentation, and the fact that it is used in several large cities in the United States makes it relevant.

**Analysis**
<br>
Socrata’s data platform continues to grow in importance, and its API is a key source of open data for many cities.
