**Background**

The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is a digital format for exchanging emergency alerts that allows a consistent alert message to be disseminated simultaneously over many different communications systems. It was developed by FEMA in collaboration with local entities and is maintained by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). OASIS has helped to extend the standard for international use.
