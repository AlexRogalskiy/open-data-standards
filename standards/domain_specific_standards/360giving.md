**Background**

At present, it is not possible to find a complete dataset on all charitable grants in the UK. 360Giving exists to change this. Our vision is that UK grantmaking is more informed, effective and strategic.

**Analysis**

This is a well-funded effort to improve insight in the grantmaking sector. The standard is aimed at U.K usage but has the potential for use internationally with local adaptations. The data registry shows almost 29 grantmakers now publishing using the standard.
