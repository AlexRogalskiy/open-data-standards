**Background**

At present, it is not possible to find a complete dataset on all charitable grants in the UK. 360Giving was developed for philanthropic giving to help grantmakers be more informed, effective and strategic.

**Analysis**

This is a well-funded effort to improve insight in the grantmaking sector. The standard is aimed at U.K usage but has the potential for use internationally with local adaptations. The data registry shows 32 grantmakers now publishing. The standard is in active use by local and national government with several local councils committed to publishing grant data in this format.
