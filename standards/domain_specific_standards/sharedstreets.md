## Background

The SharedStreets open data standard provides a common system for describing streets. This standard is designed to support complex street segment information in our modern, interconnected transportation system, enabling exchanges of street information between public and private sectors. The standard also allows for porting of data between platforms and services like OpenStreetMap, city-managed GIS systems, or commercial basemaps.

## Analysis

Cities rely on geospatial software and systems to collect, store, and share street information. It's common for cities to define their own standards for streets data, but communication between cities or countries can be difficult.

The SharedStreets standard aims to facilitate easy communication of street information globally, while maintaining clear and precise information about street details.
