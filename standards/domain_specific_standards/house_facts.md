## Background

The House Facts data standard provides a common format for reporting government data on the operation, safety, and performance of residential buildings. Reported information may include specifics regarding building structure, function, habitability safety and environmental performance. The initial version of the standard is focused on housing inspections.

## Analysis

This data standard is intended to have substantial benefits in the civic sphere including: the full disclosure of property regulatory history of property prior to rent or purchase, search of data by property owner or property address, potential analysis by government, civic or academic agencies for patterns in inspection results, creation of city benchmarking for housing health and safety and most importantly general encouragement of improved property maintenance for homeowners.
