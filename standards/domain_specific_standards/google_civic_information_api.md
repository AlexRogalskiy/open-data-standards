**Background**

The Google Civic Information API was originally released in private beta as a unified source for elections, polling places and other data from the [Voting Information Project (VIP)](../../standards/domain_specific_standards/voting_information_project_vip.md). In fall 2013, it was extended to include the ability to look up elected office holders at the local, state and national levels. The API currently supports:

*   Elections (based in [VIP](../../standards/domain_specific_standards/voting_information_project_vip.md))

*   Representatives

*   Divisions

**Analysis**

While not, strictly speaking, an open standard, the Google Civic Information aggregates several data sources, including the Voting Information Project (VIP), [Cicero](https://www.cicerodata.com/) and others. It implements the [Open Civic Data](../../standards/domain_specific_standards/open_civic_data.md) standard.
