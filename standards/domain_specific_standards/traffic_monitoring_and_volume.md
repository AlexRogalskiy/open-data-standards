**Analysis -- Future Potential and Adoption**

Traffic volume is monitored by several entities.The US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration collects data from 4,000 continuous traffic counting locations in the federal highway system.This Traffic Volume Trends (TVT) is reported by State DoTs monthly and published in PDF and Excel formats.State DOTs and local transportation agencies carry about significant additional traffic surveys.This more detailed data may be published by a few municipalities, but there is no data standard for doing so.The data is most readably available from private firms that aggregate, display or package the data, including Streetlytics, Google Maps, Waze and others.
