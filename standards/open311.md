**Background**

A 311 phone number allows for non-emergency municipal service issue reporting for situations such as street debris, potholes and nonworking streetlights as well as to obtain municipal information. OpenPlans, a nonprofit technology organization featuring digital solutions for civic problems originally developed the Open311 interoperable system that functions to coordinate standardized, open-access, read/write model for citizens to report on emergency issues. This standardized protocol allows for location based collaboration issue-tracking. A free API allows access to existing 311 services.

**Analysis**

The Open311 standard is one of the earliest and best established open data standards. It is in wide use across the United States. Some of the most prominent platforms that have adopted this system are FixMyStreet in the UK and SeeClickFix in the US. This standard is utilized by the following cities (among others): Chicago, IL; Toronto, ON; San Francisco, CA; Washington, DC; Boston, MA; New York City, NY. As 311 becomes a more commonplace service provided by municipalities, the further adoption and improvement of this standard is anticipated.
