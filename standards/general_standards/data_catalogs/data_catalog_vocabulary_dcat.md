## Background

DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the web. DCAT is intended to be used to publish information about datasets in data catalogs. It enables catalog publishers to increase discoverability and helps applications more easily utilize metadata from multiple catalogs in order to facilitate federated search.

## Analysis

The DCAT standard is the basis for the [Data.json and Common Core Metadata](../../../standards/general_standards/data_catalogs/datajson_common_core_metadata.md) effort, below.
