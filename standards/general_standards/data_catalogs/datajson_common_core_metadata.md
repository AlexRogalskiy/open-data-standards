## Background

Also known as “Slash Data”, this standard was developed by the [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/) project sponsored by the White House, and was originally known as Data.json. It is a standardized way to provide published summaries of government open data catalogs. The format was developed in conjunction with a [Common Core Metadata](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) standard.

## Analysis

While it was developed fairly rapidly, its immediate use by the federal Data.gov portal and active encouragement of adoption by both federal and local data catalogs has driven rapid adoption. The standard is also supported by all of the most common data catalog software tools, including: CKAN, DKAN, and Socrata.
