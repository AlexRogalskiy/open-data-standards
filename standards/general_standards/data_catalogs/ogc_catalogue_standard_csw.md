**Background**

The OGC developed the Catalogue Service specifically to support open geospatial data portals and repositories. While originally limited to geospatial data, it has since been used more broadly for non-spatial data and is implemented in several software tools.

**Analysis**

It is possible that CSW will be displayed by the Project Open Data Metadata Schema in coming years.
