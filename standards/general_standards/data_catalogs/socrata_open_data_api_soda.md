**Background and Analysis**

The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) is not an open standard in the usual sense – it was developed by a commercial company and the API is not managed through a collaborative process. However, Socrata provides good documentation, and the fact that it is used in several large cities in the United States makes it relevant.

**Analysis**

Socrata’s data platform continues to grow in importance, and its API is a key source of open data for many cities.
