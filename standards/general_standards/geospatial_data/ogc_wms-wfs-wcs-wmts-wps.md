## Background

_Web Map Service (WMS) 1.3_
<br>
The geographic layers and area of interest to be processed are defined by the WMS request. One or more geo-referenced images are returned and can be displayed in a browser application.

_Web Feature Service (WFS) 2.0_
<br>
Instead of sharing geographic information at the file level using a File Transfer Protocol (FTP), the WFS provides direct access to geographic information at the feature and feature property level.

_Web Coverage Service (WCS) 2.0_
<br>
Web Coverage Service (WCS) coverage data is multi-dimensional and can be accessed over the internet.

_Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) 1.0_
<br>
The Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) offers scalable, high-performance services for distribution of maps on the web.

_Web Processing Service (WPS) 1.0_
<br>
Rules for stadardization of inputs and outputs for geospatial processing services are provided by the Web Processing Service (WPS).

## Analysis

The OGC publishes a broad range of standards, most of which are not widely adopted. However, this core set of web map publishing standards is in broad use in both open source and commercial software tools and continues to provide value and have active communities of people using and improving upon them.
